Chess

UPDATE:
Now that I have some basic functionality out of this, I'll probably be focusing much more on problems that I actually need to solve. That means I'll only be making minor updates to this project for the foreseeable future.

A project in refactoring and agile development.

I chose chess for this project for two reasons.
#1 Chess was my team's main project in AP Computer Science during high school. C++ was the language to use then. Trying chess again with the new tools I've learned since that experience should give a new perspective to learn from.
#2 Chess offers a great deal of opportunities for expansion while being fairly straightforward to begin.

Goals:
- Practice Test-Driven Development. I'll be writing tests before implementing functions.
- Refactor everything all the time.
- Apply changes to code in accord with what I learn as I read through Steve McConnell's Code Complete. (added 12/10)
- Add more goals to the README.
