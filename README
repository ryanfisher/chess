Chess

A project in refactoring and agile development.

I chose chess for this project for two reasons.
#1 Chess was my team's main project in AP Computer Science during high school. C++ was the language to use then. Trying chess again with the new tools I've learned since that experience should give a new perspective to learn from.
#2 Chess offers a great deal of opportunities for expansion while being fairly straightforward to begin.

Goals:
- Practice Test-Driven Development. I'll be writing tests before implementing functions.
- Refactor everything all the time.
- Add more goals to the README.

Things I'm not worried about:
- Upfront design. I'm going very agile here. I do want to have some semblance of good design. A certain object-orientedness, for example. But planning upfront is not a concern when there are no seriously large goals to achieve.
