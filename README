Chess

A project in refactoring and agile development.

I chose chess for this project for two reasons.
#1 Chess was my team's main project in AP Computer Science during high school. C++ was the language to use then. Trying chess again with the new tools I've learned since that experience should give a new perspective to learn from.
#2 Chess offers a great deal of opportunities for expansion while being fairly straightforward to begin.
